# spacy-remote-server
Remote, multimodel SpaCy agent

## Background
This is fundamentally a JSON server driving an instance of SpaCy. Its purpose is to exercise several different models on a given {SentenceId, SentenceText} pair and return a JSON object which is the assembly of all model results on the given sentence.

A simple client.py is included from the development and testing process.

In production, the client in play lives elsewhere on a LAN and, regardless of its implementation, serves the purpose of sending sentences to this and any other agent in the ecosystem and marshalling the results for futher NLP processing.

A Java text client is included or the HTTP version (/src3)

## Work In Progress
Actual development work is being done in /src3; when all algorithms are worked out, code cleanup will change to a single /src directory.

## Running
