# spacy-remote-server
SpaCy remote multi-model server

## Background

This entire project includes a *server* written in Python which drives the SpaCy NLP platform against several different models, to process individual sentences when accessed from a *client* elsewhere.

A simple Java client is included. It is a Maven project.

This project is very much *work in progress*
